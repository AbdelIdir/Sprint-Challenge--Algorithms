## Exercise I

a) The runtime for a is 0(1), this is a linear operation.
Becaus no matter how big n is, only one operation will be run on the number n each time.


b) The runtime for n is 0(n). The number of operations will increase depending on the size of n in the for loop. The bigger n is , the bigger the loop range will be, and the more operations it will run.


c)
